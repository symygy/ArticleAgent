just released their latest model. MiniMax’s previous model, M2, has been trending at number 3 on our
AI coding models leaderboard
in Code mode, so it will be especially interesting to see how M2.1 does in comparison. MiniMax has become a global contender for fast, powerful and efficient AI models, and they continue to support open-source development by releasing model weights on
Hugging Face
. “MiniMax M2.1 feels like a sharper and more intentional version of M2, with noticeable improvements to long-horizon reasoning (successful execution of 1 shot apps), and super fast speed and efficiency.”
