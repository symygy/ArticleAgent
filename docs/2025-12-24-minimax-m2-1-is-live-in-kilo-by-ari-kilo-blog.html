<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>MiniMax has released M2.1, an incremental but meaningful improvement over M2, now available in Kilo Code. The update focuses on improved long-horizon reasoning and efficiency: the Kilo team reports that M2.1 performs better on tasks that require multi-step planning and shows notable gains in speed and resource usage. The release continues MiniMax’s open-source approach—model weights are shared on Hugging Face—making it easy for developers to experiment and deploy the model.</p>
<p>M2.1 is immediately available to Kilo Code users. The Kilo team encourages developers to stress-test the model across real-world coding tasks (code generation, debugging, and documentation), and highlights that Kilo’s Code Reviews feature can integrate M2.1 to provide AI-driven pull request feedback.</p>
<p>Overall, M2.1 appears to be a more focused and efficient iteration of M2: improvements are pragmatic (better reasoning on longer contexts and faster inference), and the release underlines MiniMax’s intent to remain competitive in open-source model development.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>MiniMax M2.1 is released and available in Kilo Code.</li>
<li>Focused improvements: better long-horizon reasoning (multi-step tasks) and faster, more efficient inference.</li>
<li>MiniMax continues to publish model weights on Hugging Face, supporting open-source adoption.</li>
<li>Kilo encourages developers to test the model on real tasks (code, docs, debugging) and integrate it into Code Reviews.</li>
<li>M2 (previous model) performed strongly on code benchmarks; M2.1 is expected to be compared against it in Code mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>MiniMax M2.1 is a practical, iterative upgrade targeting real developer workflows. If you rely on models for coding assistance or automated code review, test M2.1 on representative workloads to assess improvements in reasoning and latency. Because MiniMax publishes weights openly, teams can benchmark and deploy the model in environments where performance and cost matter.</p>
