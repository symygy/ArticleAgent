## Summary

Cursor CEO
Michael Truell
said it directly:
“The way engineering teams review code is increasingly becoming a bottleneck to them moving even faster as AI has been deployed more broadly within engineering teams.”
He’s identifying the right problem – the question is how you solve it without introducing more drag. With Code Reviews, you can choose
any model
(including 3 that are
currently completely free
), adjust strictness, select priorities, and give custom instructions. Code generation, code review, debugging – whatever you need to do throughout your entire development workflow. When we add capabilities, we build them – the economics stay the same, and you never have to worry about how model or platform lock-in will affect your workflow in an environment where standards are changing by the day.
